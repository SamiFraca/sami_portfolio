      <h2>Hi everyone, I&apos;m Sami.</h2>
      <p>
        Since I was young, I have always had a passion for computers and
        technology, which guided me towards a career that I find comfortable and
        fulfilling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went into a higher degree involving software web development and since
        day one, i knew this was for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, i started working at Flat101 at 19 years old, (where i am
        still). Now im 21 and i have been working on web development since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus on ecommerce development, involving databases,backend and
        frontend.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy exploring different technologies and approaches
        to enhance my professional growth and skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself a technology enthusiast, I enjoy discovering new
        things and learning from them. Whenever I have an opportunity to explore new ideas, I&apos;m always up
        for the challenge
